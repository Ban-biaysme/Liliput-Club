        <h3><i class="fas fa-child"></i> Before and After School Care</h3>
        <p><strong>Since 2009, Liliput Club has been committed to providing the very best in before- and after-school programmes for busy families like yours.</strong></p>

        <p> We understand how hard it is to juggle the workday schedule, and the anxiety associated with finding safe, fun, high-quality care for your children. 
          That’s why our programmes are developed in consultation with the school and the local community to feature a diverse mix of entertainment, 
          education and relaxation. Your kids will feel 
          right at home doing activities like cooking, crafts or games, as well as having time to do their homework and relax after a busy day of learning.</strong></p>

      <div class="sub2">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-child"></i> Holiday Program</h3>
        <p><strong>Liliput Club’s holiday programmes give your kids the opportunity to do the things they enjoy in a supportive and encouraging environment.</strong> </p>
        <p>
          We take the stress out of school holidays by giving you the confidence that your children are having a blast and being well-cared for at the same time. 
          Your 5-13-year olds will love the huge variety of activities and trips that are designed to inspire and entertain.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have more than 50 holiday programmes running throughout New Zealand, all of which are approved by the Ministry of Social Development as fulfilling their safety requirements.

      <h3><i class="fas fa-child"></i> Oscar Subsidies</h3>
        <p> <strong>We're OSCAR approved, which means you may be able to get a WINZ subsidy to help you with programme costs.</strong></p>
        <p>
          If you’re eligible, you can claim up to 20 hours per week for before- and after-school care and up to 50 hours per week for school holiday programmes.
        We’ll work with you and your local Work and Income office to make sure that the process of applying for and receiving an OSCAR subsidy 
        is straightforward and stress-free.

      <p>We know that before- and after-school care is a necessity for many families. That's why our programmes wrap around the school day, creating a warm, supportive environment that makes your kids feel right at home. </p>
     
      <div class="logo"> 
       <i class="fas fa-atom"></i>FUN AND EDUCATIONAL
       </div>
      <p>There’s always plenty to do at Liliput Club, from baking to artwork to sports and games. We have an extensive range of activities so no two days are the same, with hundreds of 'tried and true' craft, cooking and game activities.
         Plus, your kids get the opportunity to do their homework and relax after their busy day. </p>

          <i class="fas fa-atom"></i>OSCAR & MSD APPROVED
        </div>
         <p> Liliput Club’s programmes meet the Ministry of Social Development’s Standards for Approval for OSCAR programmes, which means that if you qualify for an OSCAR subsidy, you can put it towards the cost of your Liliput Club membership. 
          All our sites are reviewed annually to ensure the highest standards of performance and safety.</p>
       <div class="logo"> 
          <i class="fas fa-atom"></i>PEACE OF MIND
        </div>
      <p>All Liliput Club staff who work with children enrolled in our OSCAR programmes are police vetted, and these safety checks are repeated every three years. We are committed to the recognition and prevention of 
        child abuse in our community and support the roles of statutory agencies such as Oranga Tamariki.  </p>
